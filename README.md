I'm excited to share my latest web project — A'lenz, a sleek and modern lens shopping website inspired by real-world e-commerce experiences like Lenskart and Titan Eyeplus.
From product filters and cart modals to responsive design and a light blue theme — this was a full-stack creative journey!
This project helped me learn:
Professional UI/UX design techniques
HTML, CSS, JS integration
Realistic shopping features like wishlist, cart, and payment modals
Mobile responsiveness and filter logic
